# Movement-biomechanics-project
Biomechanics Class project - Use of multibody dynamics for kinematic and dynamic analysis of movement

This project consists in two separate programs: 

KinematicsAnalysis Folder - Kinematics analysis of human gait cycle and squat using a multibody system and motion data

Biomecanica-Dyn-Master Folder - Forward dynamic analysis of the human gait cycle.
