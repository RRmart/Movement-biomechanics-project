This program performs the foward dynamic analysis of a multibody system performing the human gait cycle and squat, therefore comupting the 
joint reaction forces and moments throughout each time point.

In Matlab, to perform the whole program (perform pre-processing and kinematic analysis) run the script 

"DynamicAnalysis.m"

--
The flowchart for the implementation of the program is shown in the file "Flowchart1.jpg". 
The file "ProcessingFile.txt" contains the necessary information about the multibody system to be studied (bodies, joints and drivers, which contain the information for the driving constraints).
