This program models the human body as a 2D multibody system and performs the kinematics analysis of gait and squat movements, through computation of position, velocity and acceleration and using motion data acquired at a lab.

The model contains 14 rigid bodies connected by 13 revolute joints.

In Matlab, to perform the whole program (perform pre-processing and kinematic analysis) run the script 

"KinematicAnalysis.m"


To obtain EMG Results run the script

"EMGplot.m"
